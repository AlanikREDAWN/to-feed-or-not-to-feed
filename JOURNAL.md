# June 20th - finally starting!!
## 4:30pm -ish
Okay, so hello world! I had this idea a while ago, but since I'm such a noob with electronics, I was super nervous to start. But, I'm finally going to just do it. My idea is to have a cat feeder indicator that has two leds (for two cats). Whenever an led is lit, that means that a cat needs to be fed. Once the cat is fed, the feeder will press the button beneath the led to turn it off for about 2-3ish hours until the cat needs to be fed again. Hopefully it's simple enough for me to execute. I'm thinking of using an orpehus pico instead of a seeed xiao for an mcu, but I'm going to do some more research later. Right now I just wanted to get my thoughts for the project out, so I'll come back later to start researching. My family does a movie night every Friday, so I might end up sketching my ideas while watching something. Anyways, bye for now!

Quick update before I get started, no I haven't worked on this since my last update :heavysob:. I think what I'm gonna do is just start throwing things into KiCad and playing around. So...off I go to open KiCad.

I started throwing things into KiCad and realized that idk what I'm doing, but we're just gonna make it work. I still need to add an mcu.
